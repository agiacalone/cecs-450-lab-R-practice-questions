# CECS 450 Lab Assignment: Introduction to R with Practice Questions
## 20 Points

### Assignment Description
Answer the following questions using the R programming language. Assume that all answers are complete and you will 'provide' any additional resources (like CSV files and such). You may work with a partner on these, but each student must submit their own copy of the responses to their own git repository.

1. Write R code to create a vector of numbers from 1 to 20 and then extract all even numbers from it.

Answer for this question

2. Using the `dplyr` package, load a CSV file named "data.csv," and create a new data frame that contains only rows where the "Age" column is greater than 25.

Answer second question

3. Write R code to calculate the factorial of a given positive integer `n`.

Answer third question

4. Create a bar chart using the `ggplot2` package to visualize the counts of unique values in a categorical variable from a data frame.

5. Define a matrix in R and write code to calculate the sum of all elements in the matrix.

6. Write a function in R that takes a string as input and returns the reverse of the string.

7. Using the `data.table` package, load a CSV file named "data.csv," and calculate the average value of the "Price" column for each unique value in the "Category" column.

8. Write R code to generate a sequence of first 10 prime numbers.

9. Given a data frame with a column named "Date" in date format, write R code to extract and display the month and year from each date.

10. Load a CSV file into R, and then calculate the correlation coefficient between two numeric columns in the data frame.

### Deliverables
Commit the answers to the questions in a readable file to your git repository by the due date and time indicated with your repository. Approved file submission formats are: .txt, .md, .pdf. .html (renderable) or anything that is web-readable on Github. Other formats will only be accepted with explicit approval.
